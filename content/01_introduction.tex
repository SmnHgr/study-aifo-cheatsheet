\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Artificial Intelligence (AGI)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item broad concept
    \item different interpretations
    \item we do not have a definition of intelligence
    \item a hypothetical computer program that can perform intellectual tasks as well or better than a human
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
\textcolor{blue}{Examples of application (today)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Personalization of news feeds
    \item Product searching and recommendation s on eCommerce platforms
    \item Voice-to-text
    \item Predictive maintenance
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Statistical machine learning}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Algorithms and applications where computer learn from data
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Turing Test}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Also called imitation game
    \item Tests of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from that of a human
    \item Has some philosophical problems (Complex problems, humans cant solve / AI must learn to lie)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Bias}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Results that are systematically prejudiced due to faulty assumptions
    \item The inability for a machine learning method (like linear regression) to capture the true relationship, eg. Straight Line can't be curved like the true relationship
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Variance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The difference in fits between training and testing set (different data sets in general)
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Low variance} Sum of Squares are very similar for different datasets
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Predictive modeling}

Train model for predictions \\

\textbf{Feature}

e.g. Years of working experience, school grades

The ideal ML algorithm has low bias and can accurately model the true relationship and it has low variability by producing consistent predictions across different datasets. \\

\textbf{Feature Engineering}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The process of identifying useful, additional input from the data
    \item A typical preprocessing step before the actual learning process starts
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Deep neural network}

ANNs with multiple hidden layers \\

\subsection{7 Steps of Machine Learning}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Gathering data} Collect quantity/quality data for training/testing
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Preparing that data} Cleanup data (remove duplicates, correct errors, deal with missing values, normalize data, convert data types)
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Choosing a model} Select the right algorithm(s)
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Training} Train the model, each iteration of process is a training step
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Evaluation} Use metrics to measure objective performance of the model, test model against previously unseen data, good train/eval split is 80/20, 70/30
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Hyperparameter tuning} Try to improve upon the positive results achieved during the evaluation through gamble with stepNumber of training steps, learning rate, initialization values and distribution
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Prediction} Model should be ready for practical applications
\end{enumerate}
